## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

Iâ€™ve always wanted to make a game that others would enjoy playing. Inspired by older console games like Zelda and Pokemon, I have started the creation of my own, Valaria! This Fantasy RPG set in a mediaval world where magic and swordsmanship are an everyday skill. You the player, has to fight through monsters and upgrade your gear to progress. 

Happy adventuring!
